2.fast-forward means it will move our branch tip forward to the end of our feature branch and also it will keep all commits created in our feature branch sequential while integrating that back our main branch.

3.branching allows us to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from the others it will be helpful to merge the versions later.

4.we can have multiple remote repositories but when it comes to project we prefer single repository.
